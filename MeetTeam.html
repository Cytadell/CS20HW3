                                        After 20 years of retirement, Old man McCloud is bored out of 
                                        his mind and has nothing to do except spam call absolutely anyone.
                                        McCloud has no qualms subjecting your intended target to hour long
                                        rants about "the good old days" and the "problem with kids these days."
                                        Will he ever stop? We don't know!

                                        Ever since June 2020 (no correlation to the beta release of ChatGPT-3),
                                        our scientists has been training a new AI model. While most scientist train their
                                        learning models content from the internet, our researchers have been feeding
                                        our AI it's own data for years! Now capable of gibbering in ways never thought possible,
                                        our *not ChatGPT AI is given the important task of spam bombing your intended
                                        target with calls and text messages dunked in pure insanity.

                                        Among the Devils many evil deeds and cruel side gigs, many would be surprised to learn
                                        that the devil works at a call center. What many don't know is that the devil
                                        not only works with us at Infinite Caller, but also is a certified hacker.
                                        Here at Infinite Caller, the devil works its IT magic by calling your intended
                                        with numbers diguised as your intended targets known contacts? Is that a call 
                                        from mom? Nope, it's the screams of an eldritch horror!
